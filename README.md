# OHI-O_2019
Ohio State 2019 Hackathon

For the 2019 OHI/O Hackathon my team and I tackled the company, Engie's Challegne which called for us to create a dashboard displaying energy data from the 490 buildings at Ohio State by taking in multiple csv files with raw data from meters placed around campus.

# What We Did
Utilizing R, the team took in the data and began working to make sense of it. From there, we manipulated it as needed, creating ggmaps and graphs to visualize the data and make it user friendly.
From there, we created a dashboard using html, javascript, and css to display the maps, graphs, and information that gave an explanation explainnig what kWh and BTU represent.
